### Flip packs

**Author:** hlolve

**Status:** Draft

This proposal is to complement non mandatory flips.

Is a way to allow more flips per ID without the problem to select just easier words pairs from a bigger set of pairs,
and trying to maintain majority of current flip rules, for creating and reporting.

Each ID that decides to submit flips will select how many "packs" will submit each epoch.

Packs could be from 1 to 5 and will have the same behavior as current flips have.

Will be like a second level of flips, but evaluated individually, 1 flip reported in the pack and that pack loses rewards.

Each pack will have 1 to 5 flips and same rules as currently (4 and 5 optional)

IIP-7 will be modified, so it will keep flip stake rewards but limited to a top of 100 x voting discrimination
(currently about 60,000 idnas)

Pack 2 to 5 will increase flip rewards, each by 15%
In that way we will have incentives for more flips and for keeping just 1 ID, so will help to reduce validating multiple accounts.

If submitted 5 packs and 1 reported the pack 2 will receive 15% extra, pack 3 +30% and 4 +45% but lost rewards of pack 5 plus 60%.
If more than 1 pack is reported all extra is lost ( from 2 and 3 ).

In eack pack 3 flips are mandatory, and after first pack have 3 flips submited a new one can be revealed if user accept.
So all packs above 1 are also optional and each user will decide how many submit during epoch time.

In all packs revealed at least 3 flips must be submitted or not allowed to participate in next ceremony.

Newbie can apply for up to 3 packs
Verified up to 4 packs
Human 5 packs
